# Police Officer Ticket Simulator

 * For this assignment you will design a set of classes that work together to 
 * simulate a police officer issuing a parking ticket. 
 * You should design the following classes:
 * 
 * The ParkedCar Class: This class should simulate a parked car. The class's responsibilities are as follows:
 * To know the car's make, model, color, license number, and the number of minutes
 * that the car has been parked.
 * The ParkingMeter Class: This class should simulate a parking meter. The class's only responsibility is as follows:
 * To know the number of minutes of parking time that has been purchased.
 * 
 * The ParkingTicket Class: This class should simulate a parking ticket. The class's responsibilities are as follows:
 * To report the make, model, color, and license number of the illegally parked car
 * To report the amount of the fine, which is $25 for the first hour or part of an hour that the car is illegally parked,
 *  plus $10 for every additional hour or part of an hour that the car is illegally parked
 * To report the name and badge number of the police officer issuing the ticket
 * 
 * The PoliceOfficer Class: This class should simulate a police officer inspecting parked cars. The class's responsibilities are as follows:
 * To know the police officer's name and badge number
 * To examine a ParkedCar object and a ParkingMeter object, and determine whether
 * the car's time has expired
 * To issue a parking ticket (generate a ParkingTicket object) if the car's time has
 * expired
 * 
 * Write a program that demonstrates how these classes collaborate. Make the aforementioned classes nested classes within
 * the class containing your main method; only this outermost class can be declared public.
